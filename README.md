## Source Code for the Paper *Fuel Consumption in Oscillatory Traffic: Experimental Results*
#### By Fangyu Wu and Raphael Stern for TRB Conference 2016

The source runs in Python and has the following dependencies:
+ Numpy
+ Matplotlib
+ OpenCV
+ Scikit-Learn

The algorithm, along with other utilities functions, are packaged into a class DynamicsExtractor. The smoothing and differentiation code runs in Matlab. 

To run the code, please do:

`(Python) python DynamicsExtractor.py` (only run STEP 1)  
`(Matlab) DynamicsExtractor`  
`(Python) python Dynamics Extractor.py` (only run STEP 3)  

If you spot bugs in the script or encountered any issues, please kindly contact the author Fangyu Wu (fwu10@illinois.edu). We will address the problems as soon as possible.
